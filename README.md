# Survey App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/eduardogc/survey-react-ts-ramda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/eduardogc/survey-react-ts-ramda)
A survey app made with React and TypeScript. It uses [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) for specific purposes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

For installing dependencies, just type:

`yarn`

### `yarn start`
